h1. Shortly

A Ruby wrapper for various url shortener services

h2. Installation

create a dependency in your Gemfile
@gem 'shortly'@  then run
@bundle install@
and shortly will be up and running. or @gem install shortly@

h2. Uses

Currently Shortly supports three services (Bit.ly, Goo.gl, is.gd). All supported methods have been provided for all services, so you can expect at least one method(shorten) will be available for every service.

*Bit.ly*

@
bitly = Shortly::Clients::Bitly
bitly.shorten('http://justatest.com', {:apiKey => 'R_your_api_key', :login => 'your_login'})
@

Optionally you can set apiKey and login beforehand (it would be more DRY i think if you only gonna use bitly services).

@
bitly = Shortly::Clients::Bitly
bitly.apiKey  = 'your_api_key'
bitly.login   = 'your_login'
bitly.shorten('http://justatest.com')
@
